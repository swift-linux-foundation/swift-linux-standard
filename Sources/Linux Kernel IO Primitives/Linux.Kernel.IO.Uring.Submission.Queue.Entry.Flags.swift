        /// These flags modify how individual SQEs are processed by the kernel,
        /// including linking, buffer selection, and completion behavior.
        ///
        /// ## Usage
        ///
        /// ```swift
        /// // Link two operations (second runs only if first succeeds)
        /// sqe1.flags = [.ioLink]
        /// sqe2.flags = []  // Will run after sqe1 completes successfully
        ///
        /// // Force async execution
        /// sqe.flags = [.async]
        ///
        /// // Use registered file descriptor
        /// sqe.flags = [.fixedFile]
        /// sqe.fd = registeredIndex  // Index into registered files, not raw fd
        /// ```
